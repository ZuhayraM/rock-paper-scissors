# Rock Paper Scissors
Create a program where a single element, for example h1, takes username, checks whether the name has certain number
of characters. 
The name should not include more than that many characters, the name field should not be empty, the 
name should not have any special characters or numbers. 
That same h1 element should greet the user by their name then that same h1 element should give another message "Let's play!". Then it should take a user input and see if that
user input is valid (same as above) and then it should tell you who wins!
